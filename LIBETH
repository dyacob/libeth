Divisions of LibEth
===================

Syllabic Processing
-------------------
The ANSI C "strings" and "ctype" modules are extended to understand Ethiopic
syllables under Ethiopic conventions.  For instance you may do boolean tests
for Ethiopic character classes, querry and reset syllabic forms, and
progressive language sensitive orthographic simplifications for text
retreival.


Character Code Conversions
--------------------------
In the absence of any standard for Ethiopic character encoding over the
years (Unicode 3.0 will be the first recognized standard) a large miaraid
of proprietary standards have evolved.  LibEth recognizes 61 encoding and
transiliteration systems and offers conversions between most of these
systems.  The data these encoding systems occupy within the library accounts
for bulk of LibEth's mass.  This section may be thought of as a less
sophisticated version of GNU "recode".

In application this functionality of LibEth has so far been the most
often applied in web document conversion service.


Calendar Conversions
--------------------
In addition to providing the ANSI time functions (with formatting
localization of course) routines are available to convert between Gregorian
and Ethiopic calendar systems.  Since this section is often of greater
interest by itself it is also provided as a seperate package.


Other Localizations
-------------------
Routines for Ethiopic to/from Arabic numeral conversions are available
as well as for Ethiopic ordered lists generation.  Routines for the various
Ethiopic sorting schemes will later be a part of the library.

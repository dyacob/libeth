LibEth - A Wrapper Around the Standard C Library for Ethiopic Text Processing
=============================
This is a transfer of original [SourceForge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libeth/) created on January 22, 2001.

A small companion [website](https://libeth.sourceforge.net/) was also created for the original project.

LibEth's *earliest* web pages were hosted by the NetPedia service circa 1998~1999 (archived [here.](https://web.archive.org/web/19990125090614/http://libeth.netpedia.net/))

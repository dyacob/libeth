At this stage compiling libeth and installation is not very sophisticated.
A configure script to setup conditional compile flags is a project for the
future.  At the moment #define options can be set in include/config.h .


The top level Makefile has these options:

make				# build libeth.a
make install		# install  files in /usr/lib & /usr/include/libeth/


make elf			# build libeth.so
make install-elf	# install  files in /usr/lib & /usr/include/libeth/


make clean			# remove object files
make distclean		# clean just like new



To compile the utilities in tools/ the include files should be installed
or the the include path set to find the libeth headers and library.

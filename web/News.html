<h1><u>News Updates</u></h1>

<h4><i>03/11/93 (10/07/01 Euro)</i></h4>

<p align="justify">The libeth-0.34 snapshot is cvsed!  This is the production
version of libeth presently running at geez.org and for the Ethiopian News
Headlines.  Updates at the geez.org ftp site are notoriously slow in appearing,
the CVS repository will be kept current however.  The v0.40 tree should be
appearing before long, it has fallen out of sync with v0.34 recently.</p>

<p align="justify">The 0.40 objectives will be outlined here shortly.  Some
info for review is added <a href="0.40/Dates.html">here</a> which details
where the <code>estrftime</code> rewrite is headed and introduces changes
to the LGRP for calendrical pseudo-scripting language.

<p align="justify">The production versions of Zobel and Convert::Ethiopic are
added to CVS as well.  These packages are mostly just in need of documentation
(takes forever) before they can receive the "final release" blessing for the
long awaited v0.20.</p>

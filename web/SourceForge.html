<h2>Sorce Forge Statement</h2>

<p align="justify">From afar I've admired Source Forge and watched its progress
and growth in services with the intention of one day migrating over.  With the
sudden closure of libeth's previous home site <i>(thanks while it lasted
Netpedia!)</i> the day has come sooner than I had expected.  Which isn't
necessarily a bad thing, I'm pushed into a bit of updating and clean up work
to make the project presentable to a wider audience.</p>

<p align="justify">I hope to have all libeth materials fully migrated into
the Source Forge realm by mid February.  Until then anticipate the hazards
of broken and out of date links and information in the content here.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>

<h3>Where is LibEth Headed</h3>

<p align="justify">The original intentions of the 0.34 release are pretty
much abandoned at this point and the bulk of which will now be pushed off to
0.35.  0.35 has been in development for sometime, internally it is a 
different creature from the previous releases, some updates are be backed
int the 0.34 tree periodically.  My original intention was to move into
Source Forge at the 0.35 release.  Some forthcoming features are:</p>

<b>v0.35 Targets</b>
<ul>
  <li>Extended Ethiopic is handled more efficiently, making libeth leaner,
      meaner.
  <li>More fonts faces, character sets  (need to get a list together).
  <li>Memoizing get_fchar to cache codes already converted <i>-speedy!</i>
  <li>Enhanced locale logic.
  <li>Calendar code data for as many as 12 languages.
  <li>Calendar codes have Eritrean holidays.
  <li>estrftime is a simple wrapper around strftime, Ethiopic % escapes are
      provided.
  <li>#defines are name space safe.
  <li>Maybe Gurage calendar conversions.
</ul>

<b>v0.36 Targets</b>
<ul>
  <li>Definitely Gurage calendar conversions.
  <li>Introductory indexing features.
  <li>Alternative coallation systems.
</ul>

<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
<p align="justify"><a href="ZobelBet.html"><img src="ZobelLogo.gif" align="left" border=0></a>
<font size=+1>Z</font>obel is the latest software of the Ge'ez Frontiers
Foundation (GFF) that is now bringing you Ethiopic web pages with your favorite
fonts under the Ethiopia Online domain.  Zobel is not just a new version
of our old software <em>-it is a completely new software from the ground up.</em></p>

<p align="justify">Zobel itself works as a server for the 
<a href="../LiveGeez.html">LiveGe'ez Remote Processing Protocol</a> (LGRPP)
which allows us to give you Ethiopic web pages not just on <em>our</em> computer
but also on <em><b>your computer.</b></em>  That's right, to use Zobel software
you don't even have to install it.  Publishing your web pages with Zobel is just
a matter of linking to the pages.</p>


<h3><u>Who is Riding Zobel?</u></h3>
<p align="justify"><font size=+1>F</font>our organizations have already expressed interest in
applying Zobel to bring their web visitors Amharic and Tigrigna web pages
in most 
<a href="../CharacterSets.html">every font system</a>
in use on the Internet.  Zobel is used by default at Ethiopia Online at such web
sites as The Ethiopian News Headlines, Tobia and the Geja Kale Heywet Church.  
Organizations outside of Ethiopia Online using Zobel are:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://zobel.geez.org/file=http://www.washera.com/index.x.html">Washera Online Books and Videos</a>

<h3><u>Why LiveGe'ez?</u></h3>

<p align="justify"><font size=+1>T</font>he LiveGe'ez Remote Processing Protocol
grew out of the need to better organize and formalize the way Ethiopic web
services worked at Ethiopia Online.  The specification was expanded to allow
for the remote processing of web documents by other organizations.</p>

<p align="justify">While the Ge'ez Frontiers Foundation's software that runs the Ethiopic services under Ethiopia Online has always been freely available we've found some obstacles to using it have been:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The software has to be compiled, configured and installed for the architecture and operating system of the web host.
  <p align="justify">
  <li>The organization must have permission to install the software and software libraries at the host site.
</ol>

<p align="justify">The LGRPP has been proposed to alleviate the issues related
to the software use.  With access to a LiveGe'ez server; no software need be
installed or periodically upgraded and no architecture or operating system
conflicts can occur.</p>

<p align="justify">The LGRPP is intended to bring the power of our web publishing
software to the masses.  The LGRPP will remain in a draft status until June
30<sup>th</sup>.  We invite your comments to enhance the protocol specification
to ensure that all of the services you would request are supported.</p>


<h3><u>What is the Status of Zobel?</u></h3>
<p align="justify"><font size=+1>Z</font>obel is still an early technology and will be growing throughout '99.
Zobel now implements the CGI services specified in the LGRPP.  Development
work will focus primarily on filling out the implementation of the HTML 
conversion services of the protocol.  The initial versions of Zobel will
convert only UTF7, UTF8 or SERA as input encoding.  Moving away from this
limitation to accepting any font system encoding as input is also a very high
priority.  The Zobel development status page can be found <a href="Zobel-ToDo.html">here.</a></p>


<h3><u>Where Can I Get It?</u></h3>
<p align="justify"><font size=+1>T</font>he great thing about the Zobel server is that you already
have it.  There is nothing to install.  However if you would like to run
your own Zobel server you are most welcome to do so.  The latest version of
Zobel, LibEth, and the Perl Ethiopic package can be found here first,
<a href="ftp://ftp.ethiopic.org/pub/libeth/">ftp://ftp.ethiopic.org/pub/libeth/</a>,
and will appear at 
<a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/">CPAN archives</a>
(under "authors/id/D/DY/DYACOB") within a few days of new releases.</p>


<h3><u>Why the Name "Zobel"?</u></h3>
<p align="justify"><font size=+1>Z</font>obel was the legendary horse of King Fasiliadas.  Zobel was legendary for his
speed, agility and intelligence.  Zobel's top speed was never certain, he would
run as fast as he felt the king wanted him to go.  King Fasil is said to have
described Zobel as
"...unlike any horse born before him.  When he races I become unaware of his
motion, of any motion, I feel we are frozen and the world is turning below us."
Zobel served King Fasil loyally and some go as far as to credit the king's
companion with the foundation of modern day Ethiopia.  The name "Gondar" in 
fact means "by the side of" referring to by the side of Zobel, where King Fasil
would sleep on their many journeys.</p>

<p align="justify">Likewise our Zobel is an Internet server that we hope will
help the modern day foundation of Ethiopia in cyberspace.</p>


<h3><u><em>Chie Ferresie!  Chie!</em></u></h3>
<p align="justify"><font size=+1>Z</font>obel can actually perform <em>a lot</em> of services and
different ways of outputting web pages.  We will be offering advanced options
to the font menus at Ethiopia Online shortly.  We are also in the process of 
preparing basic and advanced publishing manuals and possibly a Zobel FAQ
pending user feedback.  A <em>basic</em> Zobel web publishing tutorial is

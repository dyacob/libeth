<h3><u>Convert::Ethiopic Development Schedule</u></h3>

<p>Convert::Ethiopic is showing its age and was my first attempt at PerlXS.
Two years and 20,000+ lines of XS code later I'm joining the leagues of the
1337 XS hax0rs but Convert::Ethiopic has yet to benefit from said proficiency
gains.  This is what v0.20 is all about.  v0.20 is nearing completion and
development releases are available <a href="ftp://ftp.geez.org/pub/perl-unicode/">here.</a></p>


<ul>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; <strike>Clean up development release.</strike>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; <strike>Rebuild interface to expect hash arguments.</strike>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; <strike>System objects should set defaults values.</strike>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; <strike>Finish off Char class.</strike>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Update README file.
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Update POD.
  <li> <b><i>Release Convert::Ethiopic v0.20.</i></b>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; inevitable bug fixes.
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; The "Date" class perhaps should inherit from some parent calendar class.
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Consider if the "File" class should inherit from the FileHandle class.
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Examine the Unicode::String pacakge to see what is worth employing.
  <li> <b><i>Release Convert::Ethiopic v0.21.</i></b>
  <li> &nbsp;&nbsp; Return to the next-gen libeth, resequence Convert::Ethiopic.
  <li> <b><i>Release Convert::Ethiopic v0.22.</i></b>
</ul>

* systems/ethiosys.map:  Added Ethiopia Jiret Set I/II typefaces.

Sat Nov 10 19:09:38 EST 2000

* systems/seralex.l:  "<"[/]?[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]">" is now just 
  "<"[/]?[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll] to account for Office 2000 generated docs that insist
  on adding attributes to the <html> entitie.

Sun Feb 13 15:57:47 EST 2000

* lib-src/sysinfo.c/fidel_sputc:  added loop to handle output for extensions
  mapping.  "hasExtendedEthiopic" added.

  comprehensible:  BASIC_ETHIOPIC_BEGIN, BASIC_ETHIOPIC_END, etc.

* include/fidel.map:  ExtendedEthiopicToBasicEthiopicMap added to map extensions
  onto the basic range for fonts where extension support has not been added.
  Could be good for Ethiopian language transliteration.

Thu Jun  3 18:17:56 EET 1999

* systems/seralex.l/my_yyinput:  reworked this to be faster in general and not
  break for strings of length 1.  Another fix to the <LANG> section that wasn't
  exitting nicely.

Thu Jun  3 10:22:39 EET 1999

* lib-src/sysinfo.c/get_setName:  added forgotten "break" statements for
  tfanus systems.

Sat May 29 07:20:34 EET 1999

  reworked so that "ethiosoft" and "gezbausi" are unique system types.

Thu May 27 22:10:09 EET 1999

* systems/seralex.l:  all cases of "return yytext[0]" are now 
  "return ( 0x00ff & yytext[0] )" to prevent 8-bit values from taking forms like
  0xffcf instead of 0x00cf -don't know why this was happenning.

Thu May 27 06:31:41 EET 1999

* systems/tfanus.map:  added diacritic identifiers to hash table.

Wed May 26 12:40:24 EET 1999

  in array indexi.

Sun Apr 18 19:56:42 EET 1999

  at 0xff as the preferred choice over 0xa0.

Sat Apr 17 23:18:59 EET 1999

* include/libeth.h:  aynIsZero becomes an option.  This didn't really
  happen on Saturday but a new release is shipping today with, at last
  Zobel seeing the light of day...

Sat Apr 10 19:43:08 EET 1999

* lib-src/langxs.c:  is added for interfacing with other languages such
  as Perl or VB.  langxs.c code is moved out of the LibEth.xs source
  module.  image_sputs is moved from LibEth.xs into systems/filters.c.

Sat Apr 10 16:53:22 EET 1999

* lib-src/sysinfo.c:  adjustments for transfer variant output with mixed
  options.  New options are "debug", and "ethOnly".  "decimal" output is
  added as a transfer variant.

Fri Apr  9 22:14:24 EET 1999

* include/libeth.h:  "options" flag added where extraneous options can be
  ORed together.  etstdlib.c, seralex.l, sera.c, dehai.c and sysinfo.c are
  updated accordingly.

* lib-src/etstdio.c:  Arguement 1 of get_fchar is no longer used and so now
  has been eliminated throughout.

Fri Apr  9 10:03:14 EET 1999

* systems/brana.map:  corrected mappings for zWa, Ilf, Ku->Ko.

* systems/sera.c/SERAToUnicode:  lexer_push(x) added when `x is detected in
  latin mode.  Only ` was being returned and x was lost.

Fri Apr  2 15:46:28 EET 1999

* systems/geezfont.c:  corrections to hash table and GeezFontToUnicode to
  get input working correctly.

Sat Mar 27 20:26:19 EET 1999

* include/libeth.h, lib-src/etstdlib.c, systems/dehai.c, systems/sera.c:  
  "gspace" and "qmark" and now "gSpace" and "qMark" to keep interCaps
  use consistant.

Thu Mar 25 13:44:38 EET 1999

* systems/sera.c:  check for out of range characters added so we don't break
  the hash tables.

Wed Mar 24 21:33:13 EET 1999

* systems/sera.c: fixes for ' handling after the legal but odd sequence 
  "I'aa" broke the lexer.

* systems/acis.c,ethcita.c,feedel.c,geezfont.c,samawerfa.c:
  Systems using "READNEXT" to handle butterfly processing are bug fixed
  so that formNumber is not doubly subtracted.

* systems/geezfont.map:  more minor refinements to tables.

* "debug" output is noted as broken, will fix this in 0.34 making debug a
  transfer variant.


Tue Mar 23 17:15:57 EET 1999

* #define bzero(addr, cnt) memset(addr, 0, cnt)
  added to lib-src/etmath.c, doctypes/rtf.c and calendar/ettime.c. bzero 
  elliminated from doctypes/html.c.  This lets libeth compile with non-BSD
  compatible compilers.

* systems/geezfont.map:  minor refinements to hash table.

* lib-src/redterms.c:  #include<detail.h> added for WIN32 compilation.

* libeth compiles as a Windows DLL and we freeze 0.33 now to get back into
  Gurage, Bench, Bilin, Agaw and other good languages.


Wed Mar 17 19:12:57 EET 1999

* systems/unicode.c:  added "UnicodeToName" to return Unicode character names
  when get_fchar is passed the "uname" identifier.

* EthCITA systems are added but not tested.

Sun Mar 14 16:37:08 EET 1999

* include/libeth.h:  stringTop added to LibEthFlags structure after crashes
  from end of string detection problems -the "top" counter is reset to zero
  the first time getToken is called.  If getToken is called again everything
  starts over.  This seemed to be the best fix.

* lib-src/sysinfo.c/get_fchar:  iostring elliminated, test for stringTop added.

* systems/seralex.c:  iostring elliminated but not top, we keep the top 
  counter for now as it seems otherwise awkward to remove and definitely
  makes code harder to read.

* systems/systemio.c:  getToken and ungetToken updated for stringTop.
  "top" variable is now elliminated.

Wed Mar 10 17:28:57 EET 1999

* lib-src/sysinfo.c, systems/samawerfa.c:  sam98 and samwp systems added
  for I/O.

* lib-src/sysinfo.c, systems/tfanus.c:  tfanusnew added and labializations
  fixed.  The only difference I can detect in the new system is another _W
  at 0xbb which formerly was an underline of sorts.  This is not important
  except for input, I still can't determine if there is a _Wi without
  authorative information

Fri Mar  5 22:10:24 EET 1999

* lib-src/etmath.c:  Add routines to support mathematics with Ethiopic
  numbers, should anyone be so inclined...

  FCHAR* itof ( int iNumber );
  FCHAR* AddEthiopicEthiopic ( FCHAR *A, FCHAR *B );
  FCHAR* SubtractEthiopicEthiopic ( FCHAR *A, FCHAR *B );
  FCHAR* MultiplyEthiopicEthiopic ( FCHAR *A, FCHAR *B );
  FCHAR* DivideEthiopicEthiopic ( FCHAR *A, FCHAR *B );
  FCHAR* AddEthiopicInteger ( FCHAR *A, int B );
  FCHAR* SubtractEthiopicInteger ( FCHAR *A, int B );
  FCHAR* MultiplyEthiopicInteger ( FCHAR *A, int B );
  FCHAR* DivideEthiopicInteger ( FCHAR *A, int B );
  FCHAR* DivideIntegerEthiopic ( int A, FCHAR *B );
  FCHAR* PowerIntegerEthiopic ( int A, FCHAR *B );

* Numerous minor tweaks to data types and castings to make VC5 happy.

* #ifdef __STDC__ becomes #if __STDC__ || WIN32 in function declarations.


Thu Mar  4 19:23:27 EET 1999

* lib-src/etstring.c:  arrays with data defined at array variable declaration 
  are rewritten for portability.

* lib-src/io.[ch]:  becomes systemio.[ch] after discovering conflict with io.h
  on Borland C++ when master include path takes precedence over local.

* lib-src/dehai.h,ethiopi.h,iso.h,mainz.h,sera.h: 
  #define IS_TRANSLIT_SYS 1 for generic detection of transliterated systems
  to include "yy.h" in systems.h

* systems/exports.h:  "||" used in place of "|" in preprocessor directives for
  consistancy.

* include/libeth.h,calendar/etime.h:  "#if !__BCC__" becomes "#ifndef __BCC__"


Tue Mar  2 11:56:06 EET 1999

* calendar/etime.data(.sera)/Ethiopic*MonthDayNames:
  uraEl corrected to `uraEl.

Mon Mar  1 11:56:06 EET 1999

* systems/powergez.c/PowerGeezExtrasToUnicode:
  (form == getToken()) correct to (form = getToken()).

Sun Feb 28 10:22:23 EET 1999

* lib-src/etstdio.c/sget_fstring:  "register char i" is now 
  "register long int i" after an index wrap around lead to segmentaion faults.
  All string indexi in lib-src/etstdio.c are now long ints to handle obscenely
  long strings.

* libeth-0.33b3 released.

Sun Feb 21 13:56:16 EET 1999

* lib-src/etctype.c:  added "ethiopicdefined" which returns "true" for defined
  code points in the Ethiopic matrix.  This routine might be integrated into
  one of the others later.

Sun Feb  7 14:56:26 EET 1999

* systems/sera.c/_UnicodeToSERA:  fixed problem with SERA output for unicode
  numbers between 10 and 100.

Thu Jan 28 19:20:43 EET 1999

* systems/geezfont.c/GeezFontToUnicode:  this time really fixed the Ge'ezFont
  output problem.

Sun Jan 17 11:20:54 EET 1999

* lib-src/etstdio.c/fidel_sputs: corrected address reference to ISO639_3Names
  that bugged SERA escape formations in output.

Tue Jan 12 22:20:01 EET 1999

* systems/feedel.map SAFEANSI and DIACRITIC values inverted in hash table
  a remnant from an older system -?

Sat Jan  9 18:14:53 EET 1999

* systems/fidelxtra.map made typeface names uppercase.

* systems/absha.map changed "AmharicQ" to "AmaharQ".

Fri Jan  8 10:43:27 EET 1999

* systems/seralex.l \~# escape now detects negative numbers.

Mon Jan  4 20:18:27 EET 1999

* Changed <libeth/libeth.h> to "libeth.h" throughout.

Sat Jan  2 08:04:30 EET 1999

* Fixed problem with "GeezEdit" in HTML mode.

* Fixed "fontFace" mapping problem with Monotype fonts.

Tue Dec 22 20:13:27 EET 1998

* Fixed "xa" and "xo" in Ge'ezFont map file.

Sat Dec 19 21:29:29 EET 1998

* PowerGe'ez support is complete.

* systems/(dehai.c, ed.c, ethiop.c, ies.c, iso.c, mainz.c, qubee.c, sera.c):
  Dehai, Mainze and Qubee systems are new, other are rewritten to use
  common principle of consonant and vowel hash tables versus large 
  memory consuming full fidel tables.  Except for SERA input is non-functional,
  this will be added to conclude the 0.33 series.

* lib-src/lethutil.c/grow_string:  malloc lines are recast as unsigned char.
  lib-src/sysinfo.c/get_setName:  CharacterSet and FontFace are now passed
    in place of LibEthFlag data type so we can make requests more arbitrarily.
  lib-src/sysinfo.c/get_setRTFPrefix:  same as get_setName.
  doctypes/html.c/fidel_HTML_sputs: ANSI section now checks if it will 
    exceed the outString size before writing to it.  Minor rewrites for
    above API changes.
  doctypes/rtf.c/get_RTF_header:  minor rewrites for above API changes.

Mon Dec 14 14:06:29 EET 1998

* LGPL notices added to all source files.  C++ "//" comments converted to
  ANSI-C safe /* ... */ .

Mon Dec 14 15:21:04 EET 1998

* calendars/Ethiopic.c/isEthiopianHoliday:  returnP and returnString are both
  initialized as "NULL" so that garbage is not returned if no holiday is
  found.  calendars/edate.c is also updated to set tm_wday so day-of-week
  names are no longer hosed.

Sun Dec 13 14:14:54 EET 1998

* lib-src/etstdio.c/fidel_sputs:  placed sera test statement outside of main
  for loop and gave the sera case its own for loop.  We should see a minor
  performance boost.

Sat Dec 12 21:43:53 EET 1998

* systems/seralex.c/lexer_flush:  is now "lexer_reset" and actually works.
  "lexer_reset" is actually needed to reset the lexer when you switch strings
  between lexer calls -or bad things happen if the previous string ended with
  a partial token (such as " ").  Works with flex, don't know about lex...

Sat Dec 12 13:25:17 EET 1998

* systems/jis.c, systems/junet.c:  JIS and JUNET output is made algorithmic
  thus eliminating the tables and saving 14k.

Sat Dec  5 20:57:17 EET 1998

* lib-src/etstring.c:  Added "fidel_lcss" and "fidel_syllabic_lcss" to find
  longest common substring between two Ethiopic strings.  Need to add this to
  the RedTerms routines later.

Fri Dec  4 19:24:19 EET 1998

*  Deleted redundant "Java" CharacterSet type.

Use and redistribute as per the GNU LGPL v2.0.  See the file "COPYING.LIB-2.0"
in this directory.


New in LibEth 0.34
==================
The "LibEthFlags" data structure is somewhat reorganized and offers more
output transfer variants and combinable "options".  Routines added for
mashalling methods when interfaced to other languages.


New in LibEth 0.33
==================
SERA no longer gets preferential treatment it is given an equal standing with
other transliteration systems though it is better implemented at the start of
the 0.33 series.  "seralex.l" is now a fraction of its original size as a 
hand-made lexer is composed for SERA (this should be faster and friendlier
to non-GNU compilers).  The f/lex lexer is called only for advanced
transliteration such as escape and punctuation tokenization.  The approach
here is that each transliteration systems will call a mutual lexer in different
start states for their common or advanced needs -avoiding the need for
independent f/lex lexers.  Non-transliteration systems no longer rely on the
f/lex tokenizer for stream control.

Extended Ethiopic handling is broken in 0.33 while private use remains 
functional.  Both regions will be migrated to the appropriate private
use region reserved under Unicode 1.1 and later and remapped as per the
Extended Ethiopic proposal.

UTF7 support is added, lots more fonts added...

Microsoft Visual Studio Notes:
=============================

Change systems/ethiopic.c to systems/ethiopix.c, should work fine.
Also set the defines BUILDLIBETH and USE_TALIGENT.
